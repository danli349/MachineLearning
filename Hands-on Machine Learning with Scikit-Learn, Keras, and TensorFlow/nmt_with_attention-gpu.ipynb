    "The short sentences often work well, but if the input is too long the model literally loses focus and stops providing reasonable predictions. There are two main reasons for this:\n",

    "1. The model was trained with teacher-forcing feeding the correct token at each step, regardless of the model's predictions. The model could be made more robust if it were sometimes fed its own predictions.\n",
    "2. The model only has access to its previous output through the RNN state. If the RNN state gets corrupted, there's no way for the model to recover. [Transformers](transformer.ipynb) solve this by using self-attention in the encoder and decoder."
